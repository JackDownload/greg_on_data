### [next novel project](https://nextnovelproject.com/)

This site was a sideproject of mine that I built to help me find some good books to read. It's similarly built using Nuxt, but it also has a backend built with Node, Express, and Sequelize.  Not to mention that the data collection process is built in Python and hosted on AWS.

All in all, a very fun project that I've found to be pretty rewarding so far...
