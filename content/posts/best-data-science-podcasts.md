## why i want to find data science podcasts

This would normally be at the top of an article on finding data science podcasts. Well it would be at the top of any article. But realistically, most people are finding this from google, and they're just looking for the answer that's at the top of the page. If you type in 'the most popular data science podcasts', you really don't want to have to scroll down endlessly to find the answer you're looking for. So to make *their* experience better, we're just leaving the answer up there. And giving them sass. Lots of sass.

Anyways, I really like listening to things. While newsletters are great for keeping up with current events and blogs are great for learning specific things, podcasts have a special place in my heart for allowing me to aimlessly learn something new every day. The format really lends itself to delivering information efficiently, but in a way where you can multitask.  Pre-COVID, my morning commute was typically full of podcasts. While COVID has rendered my commute a nonexistent affair, I still try to listen to at least a podcast a day if I can manage it.  My view is that 30 minutes of learning a day will really add up in the long run, and I feel that podcasts are a great way to get there.

Now that we've been through my love affair with podcasts, you can imagine my surprise when I started looking for a few data science ones to subscribe to and I *didn't* find a tutorial on how to use web scraping to find the most popular data science podcasts to listen to.  I know, crazy.  There's a web scraping tutorial on everything under the sun except for - seemingly - podcasts.  I mean there's probably not one on newsletters either, but we'll leave that alone for now... 

So if no one else is crazy enough to write about finding data science podcasts with web scraping, then...



## gameplanning the process

By now we're almost certainly rid of those savages who are only here for the **answer** (*gasp, how could they*), so we'll go into the little process I went through to gather the data.  It's not particularly long, and took me probably an hour to put it together, so it should be a good length for an article.

I'm using python here with an installation of Anaconda (which is a common package management / deployment system for python).  I'll be running this in a Jupyter notebook, since its a one-off task that I don't need to use ever again... hopefully.

In terms of what I'm going to do, I'll run a few google keyword searches which are limited to the 'https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/' domain and scrape the results for the first few pages.  From there I'll just be scraping the apple podcast page to get the total number of ratings and the average rating. Yea, the data will be biased, but its a quick and dirty way to get the answer I'm looking for.

## code to find top data science podcastss

    # import default python packages
    import urllib
    import requests
    import time

The above packages are included in python, the below ones aren't always included. If you don't have them installed, you'll have to download them. You can find out how to use [pip](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#use-pip-for-installing) to do it or [conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/install-packages/). 

    # import non-standard python packages
    # if you dont have these installed, install them with pip or conda
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    import pandas as pd

Now that the packages have been imported, you should define your user agent. First off, because its polite if you're scraping anything. Secondly, google gives different results for mobile and desktop searches.  This isn't actually my user-agent, I took it from another tutorial since I'm a bit lazy.  I actually use linux...

    # define your desktop user-agent
    USER_AGENT = "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:65.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/65.0"

Alright now we're going to define the queries we want to run. And then create a function that spits out the URL we want to scrape on google.  I'm putting the queries in a kwargs format, since I want to put them through a function.  That means I can just loop through the list of kwargs and get the results that the function returns.


    # Queries
    list_kwargs = [
        {"string": 'data podcast'},
        {"string": 'data podcast', "pg": 2},
        {"string": 'data podcast', "pg": 3},
        {"string": 'data science podcast'},
        {"string": 'data engineering podcast'},
        {"string": 'data visualization podcast'},
    ]

    def string_to_podcast_query(string, pg=None):
        query = urllib.parse.quote_plus(f'site:https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ {string}')
        if pg != None:
            query = query + "&start=" + str(10*(pg-1))
        return f"https://google.com/search?hl=en&lr=en&q={query}", string

    # define the headers we will add to all of our requests
    headers = {"user-agent" : USER_AGENT}

    # set up an empty list to push results to
    results = []

    # cycle through the list of queries 
    for x in list_kwargs:
        # return the query url and the search term that was used to create it (for classification later)
        url, search_term = string_to_podcast_query(**x)

        # make a get request to the url, include the headers with our user-agent
        resp = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

        # only proceed if you get a 200 code that the request was processed correctly
        if resp.status_code == 200:
            # feed the request into beautiful soup
            soup = BeautifulSoup(resp.content, "html.parser")
        
        # find all divs (a css element that wraps page areas) within google results
        for g in soup.find_all('div', class_='r'):
            # within the results, find all the links 
            anchors = g.find_all('a')
            if anchors:
                # get the link and title, add them to an object, and append that to the results array
                link = anchors[0]['href']
                title = g.find('h3').text
                item = {
                    "title": title,
                    "link": link,
                    "search_term": search_term
                }
                results.append(item)

        # sleep for 2.5s between requests.  we don't want to annoy google and deal with recaptchas
        time.sleep(2.5)

Alright, now we have the google results back - nice.  From here, lets put that in a pandas dataframe and filter it a bit.

    google_results_df = pd.DataFrame(results)

    # create a filter for anything that is an episode.  They should contain a ' | '.
    # drop any duplicate results as well.
    google_results_df['is_episode'] = google_results_df['title'].str.contains(' | ',regex=False)
    google_results_df = google_results_df.drop_duplicates(subset='title')

    google_results_podasts = google_results_df.copy().loc[google_results_df['is_episode']==False]

Ok cool, we have a list of podcasts. Lets define our apple podcasts scraper.

    def podcast_scrape(link):
        # get the link, use the same headers as had previously been defined.
        resp = requests.get(link, headers=headers)
        if resp.status_code == 200:
            soup = BeautifulSoup(resp.content, "html.parser")

        # find the figcaption element on the page
        rtg_soup = soup.find("figcaption", {"class": "we-rating-count star-rating__count"})
        # the text will return an avg rating and a number of reviews, split by a •
        # we'll spit that out, so '4.3 • 57 Ratings' becomes '4.3', '57 Ratings'
        avg_rtg, rtg_ct = rtg_soup.get_text().split(' • ')
        # then we'll take numbers from the rtg_ct variable by splitting it on the space
        rtg_ct = rtg_ct.split(' ')[0]
        
        # find the title in the document, get the text and strip out whitespace
        title_soup = soup.find('span', {"class":"product-header__title"})
        title = title_soup.get_text().strip()
        # find the author in the document, get the text and strip out whitespace
        author_soup = soup.find('span', {"class":"product-header__identity podcast-header__identity"})
        author = author_soup.get_text().strip()

        # find the episode count div, then the paragraph under that, then just extract the # of episodes
        episode_soup = soup.find('div', {"class":"product-artwork__caption small-hide medium-show"})
        episode_soup_p = episode_soup.find('p')
        episode_ct = episode_soup_p.get_text().strip().split(' ')[0]
        
        # format the response as a dict, return that response as the result of the function
        response = {
            "title": title,
            "author": author,
            "link": link,
            "avg_rtg": avg_rtg,
            "rtg_ct": rtg_ct,
            "episodes": episode_ct
        }
        return response

Cool, we now have a podcast scraper.  You can try it with the below code. 

    podcast_scrape('https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/follow-the-data-podcast/id1104371750')


    {'title': 'Follow the Data Podcast',
    'author': 'Bloomberg Philanthropies',
    'link': 'https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/follow-the-data-podcast/id1104371750',
    'avg_rtg': '4.3',
    'rtg_ct': '57'}

Back to the code.  Lets now loop through all the podcast links we have.

    # define the result array we'll fill during the loop
    podcast_summ = []
    for link in google_results_podcasts['link']:
        # use a try/except, since there are a few episodes still in the list that will cause errors if we don't do this.  This way, if there is an error we just wont add anything to the array.
        try:
            # get the response from our scraper and append it to our results
            pod_resp = podcast_scrape(link)
            podcast_summ.append(pod_resp)
        except:
            pass
        # wait for 5 seconds to be nice to apple
        time.sleep(5)

Now to put everything into a dataframe and do a little bit of sorting and filtering.

    pod_df = pd.DataFrame(podcast_summ)

    # Remove non-english podcasts, sorry guys...
    pod_df = pod_df.loc[~pod_df['link'].str.contains('l=')]
    pod_df.drop_duplicates(subset='link', inplace=True)

    # merge with the original dataframe (in case you want to see which queries were responsible for which podcasts)
    merge_df = google_results_podcasts.merge(pod_df,on='link',suffixes=('_g',''))
    merge_df.drop_duplicates(subset='title', inplace=True)

    # change the average rating and rating count columns from strings to numbers
    merge_df['avg_rtg'] = merge_df['avg_rtg'].astype('float64')
    merge_df['rtg_ct'] = merge_df['rtg_ct'].astype('int64')

    # sort by total ratings and then send them to a csv
    merge_df.sort_values('rtg_ct',ascending=False).to_csv('podcasts.csv')

From here I did a bit of cheating where I combined the title and link to create a `<a hrer="link">title</a>`, but that's mainly because I got a bit lazy...

Anyways, that was the full process in creating the above list of data science podcasts. You now have the top podcasts, sorted by total reviews.  I considered also using castbox as a source of scraping (since they have an approximation of subscribers / downloads), but I couldn't find any good way to search for generally popular podcasts.  Or podcasts that contained a certain word.
